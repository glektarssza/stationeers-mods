    <Name>Mineables Give Full Stack</Name>
    <Author>G'lek Tarssza</Author>
    <Version>0.0.1</Version>
    <Description>All mineables produce a full stack of the appropriate ore type.

A mineable is a single ore "item", which I call a "nodule". This mod does not change the how many of these nodules are present per ore vein.

This mod replaces the "Default" mineables preset for custom worlds as well as the presets for non-custom worlds.

If you want to go back to normal ores you can use the "Normal" preset for custom worlds or disable the mod.

If you just want to a preset for custom worlds without changing the defaults consider looking at my other mod that does just that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2610333374
